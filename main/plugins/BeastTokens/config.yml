  # - Do not change these settings unless you know what you're doing!
 Pool-settings:
   # Sets the maximum size of the MySQL connection pool.
   # - Basically this value will determine the maximum number of actual
   #   connections to the database backend.
   # - More information about determining the size of connection pools can be found here:
   #   https://github.com/brettwooldridge/HikariCP/wiki/About-Pool-Sizing
  Maximum-pool-size: 8

   # Sets the minimum number of idle connections that the pool will try to maintain.
   # - For maximum performance and responsiveness to spike demands, it is recommended to not set
   #   this value and instead allow the pool to act as a fixed size connection pool.
   #   (set this value to the same as 'maximum-pool-size')
  Minimum-idle: 5

   # This setting controls the maximum lifetime of a connection in the pool in milliseconds.
   # - The value should be at least 30 seconds less than any database or infrastructure imposed
   #   connection time limit.
  Maximum-lifetime: 1800000 # 30 minutes

   # This setting controls the maximum number of milliseconds that the plugin will wait for a
   # connection from the pool, before timing out.
  Connection-timeout: 5000 # 5 seconds

  #Auto save tokens to database on specified delay(Time unit are seconds).
